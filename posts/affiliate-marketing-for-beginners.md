Affiliate marketing is one of the most accessible and scalable ways to earn money online. Whether you're a content creator, blogger, or just someone looking to monetize your digital presence, affiliate marketing offers a low-barrier entry into the world of online business.

In this guide, we’ll walk through everything you need to know to get started — from choosing a niche to promoting products and earning commissions.

## What Is Affiliate Marketing?

Affiliate marketing is a performance-based business model where you promote someone else’s product or service and earn a commission for every sale or action generated through your referral link.

You don’t need to create your own product, handle customer service, or manage inventory. Your job is to drive traffic and conversions.

## How Does It Work?

Here’s a simplified breakdown:

1. You sign up for an affiliate program (e.g., Amazon Associates, Melbet Affiliates).
2. You get a unique tracking link.
3. You share that link via your blog, YouTube channel, social media, or email list.
4. When someone clicks and makes a purchase, you earn a commission.

## Step 1: Choose Your Niche

Your niche is the specific topic or audience you’ll focus on. A good niche should be:

- Something you’re interested in or knowledgeable about
- Profitable (people spend money in it)
- Not overly saturated

**Examples of profitable niches:**

- Fitness & weight loss
- Personal finance
- Gaming & betting
- Tech & gadgets
- Travel & lifestyle

## Step 2: Pick the Right Affiliate Program

Not all affiliate programs are created equal. Look for:

- High commission rates
- Reliable tracking and reporting
